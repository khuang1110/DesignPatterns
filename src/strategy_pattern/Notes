Strategy Pattern

Class Duck has methods to 
quack()
swim()
abstract display() #since every duck will look different 

each type of ducks (MallardDuck, RedheadDuck) inherits and extends Duck

Problem:
however, if extra feature is added to Duck all other types of Ducks will inherit from it 
which can cause unwanted error/behavior to other classes 
eg.when adding extra fly() method to Duck class, DecoyDuck class will also inherit fly
